  This has type: [1;31m[> #WrongFragmentName][0m
  But this function argument [1;33m~fragmentName[0m is expecting: [1;33m[#ListFragment][0m
  
  The second polymorphic variant is [1;33mclosed[0m and doesn't include the constructor: [1;31m#WrongFragmentName[0m.
  
  Possible solutions:
  - Either make the second variant [1;33mopen[0m so it can accept additional constructors. To do this, make sure the type starts with [1;33m[>[0m instead of [1;33m[[0m
  - Or add the missing constructor to it.
